    <string name="about_what_is_title">What is MicLock?</string>
    <string name="about_what_is_description">MicLock is a microphone protection app that prevents audio routing issues during phone calls. It ensures your microphone stays active and properly routed, even when other apps try to take control of the audio system. Perfect for users experiencing issues where their microphone only works on speakerphone.</string>
    <string name="about_how_it_works_title">How It Works</string>
    <string name="about_how_it_works_description">MicLock runs as a foreground service that continuously holds the microphone resource. By maintaining an active audio recording session, it prevents the Android system from routing your microphone incorrectly during calls. The app uses minimal resources and includes intelligent features like automatic pausing when the screen is off and polite yielding to other apps when needed.</string>
    <string name="about_open_source_title">Open Source</string>
    <string name="about_open_source_description">MicLock is free and open source software. This means the code is publicly available for anyone to inspect, modify, and contribute to. Open source ensures transparency, security, and community-driven development. You can trust that the app does exactly what it says—no hidden features, no data collection, no surprises.</string>
