## What is Mic-Lock?

Mic-Lock addresses a frustrating and common issue for **Google Pixel phone** users, especially those who have had their **screens replaced**. During screen replacement procedures, the **bottom microphone** can sometimes become damaged or disconnected, causing apps like WhatsApp, voice recorders, and video calling applications to record silence instead of actual audio.

This app was specifically **invented to fix this issue** by running discreetly in the background and **automatically rerouting all audio recording** from other apps to a **working microphone** (typically the **earpiece microphone**). The solution is **battery-efficient** because it uses minimal processing power to maintain the correct audio path without storing or analyzing any audio data, and intelligently steps aside when other apps need to record.

## üîß Installation

### Option 1: Download APK (Recommended for most users)
1.  Download the latest stable APK: [`releases`](https://github.com/Dan8Oren/MicLock/releases/)
2.  Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in your device settings if prompted (this is standard for sideloaded apps).
3.  Install the downloaded APK file.
4.  Grant **microphone** and **notification** permissions when the app first launches.
5.  **Crucially**, allow the app to ignore battery optimizations (usually found in App Info ‚Üí Battery Usage or similar path) to ensure uninterrupted background operation.

### Option 2: Build from Source (For developers and advanced users)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mic-lock.git
cd mic-lock
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
*Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username or organization name.*

## üéØ Quick Start

1.  **Launch the app** and complete the initial permission requests.
2.  **Tap "Start"** to activate microphone protection.
3.  **Test with WhatsApp** or another app by recording a voice message or making a call.
4.  **Enjoy working audio!** The app runs silently in the background, continuously safeguarding your microphone access.

## üì± How It Works

Mic-Lock acts as a "polite background holder" that:
1.  **Detects Faulty Microphone**: Identifies when the default microphone path is compromised (typically the bottom mic on Pixel devices).
2.  **Secures Working Mic**: Establishes and holds a connection to your device's *working* earpiece microphone array in a battery-efficient manner.
3.  **Graceful Handover**: When other apps start recording, Mic-Lock gracefully releases its hold.
4.  **Correct Path Inheritance**: The other app then inherits the correctly routed audio path to the functional microphone instead of defaulting to the broken one.
5.  **Seamless Experience**: Your recordings and calls work perfectly without manual intervention!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

-   **MediaRecorder Mode**: (Default) Offers wider compatibility, especially on older or more problematic devices, but might use slightly more battery.
-   **AudioRecord Mode**: More battery-efficient, optimized for most modern devices. If you experience high battery usage, switch to this mode.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**Q: The app doesn't seem to work, or audio is still silent.**
A: Try switching between **MediaRecorder Mode** and **AudioRecord Mode** in the app's settings. Some device configurations might prefer one over the other.

**Q: The app stops working after some time.**
A: It's intentionally, the app stops when the screen is off to save battery.
Inevitably after some time the system will destroy the background process and a notification to restart the app will be sent to easily restart it again.
