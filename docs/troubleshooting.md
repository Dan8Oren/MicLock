3. Stop and restart the service after changing modes.
4. Test again with WhatsApp or another recording app.

### High battery usage

1. **Switch to AudioRecord Mode** in MicLock settings
2. **Verify battery optimization** is disabled (see [Setup Guide](setup.md#3-disable-battery-optimizations-critical))
3. **Restart the device** after making changes

### App stops working after device restart

1. **Check battery optimization settings** - they may have been reset
2. **Manually restart MicLock** after reboot
3. **Enable auto-start** in your device's app management settings

**Solutions**:
1. **Reinstall the app**: Uninstall and reinstall MicLock
2. **Check APK integrity**: Re-download from official source

4. **Restart device**: Simple reboot can resolve many issues

### Compatibility with Other Apps

**Issue**: Specific apps still don't work with MicLock

**Troubleshooting**:
1. **Test app order**: Start MicLock first, then the recording app
2. **Check app permissions**: Ensure the recording app has microphone permission
3. **Try different recording mode**: Switch between MediaRecorder/AudioRecord
4. **Report compatibility**: Use our [Device Compatibility Report](https://github.com/yourusername/mic-lock/issues/new?template=device_compatibility.md)

## 🔍 Advanced Diagnostics

### Check Service Status

1. Open MicLock app
2. Observe the status display:
   - **"ON"**: Service running and holding microphone
   - **"PAUSED"**: Service running but yielding to another app (normal)
   - **"OFF"**: Service not running (problem)

### Log Analysis (Advanced Users)

If you can access Android logs via ADB:

```bash
adb logcat | grep -i "miclock\|mic_lock"
```

Look for:
- Permission errors
- Audio system errors
- Service lifecycle issues

### Test Without MicLock

1. Stop MicLock service
2. Test recording apps to confirm the original problem exists
3. Start MicLock and test again to verify it's working
