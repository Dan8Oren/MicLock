# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 2024*

## Overview

Mic-Lock is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. This privacy policy explains how Mic-Lock handles your information and protects your privacy.

## Data Collection

**Mic-Lock does not collect any personal data.**

Specifically, Mic-Lock does NOT:
- Collect any audio recordings
- Store any personal information
- Transmit any data over the internet
- Track user behavior or usage patterns
- Collect device identifiers
- Gather analytics or crash reports
- Access your contacts, messages, or other personal files

## How Mic-Lock Works

### Local Processing Only
- All microphone routing and audio processing occurs entirely on your device
- No audio data leaves your device through Mic-Lock
- The app only manages which microphone other apps use - it does not record or store audio

### Permissions Required

Mic-Lock requests only the minimal permissions necessary for its functionality:

1. **Microphone Access**: Required to establish microphone routes and detect when other apps are recording
   - Used only for route management, not for recording audio
   - No audio content is captured or stored by Mic-Lock

2. **Notification Access**: Required to display service status and control notifications
   - Used only to show when the service is active or paused
   - No notification content from other apps is accessed

3. **Boot Completed**: Optional permission to automatically start the service after device restart
   - Used only to restore microphone protection after reboot
   - No other system events are monitored

## No Network Access

Mic-Lock does not require or use internet connectivity:
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No updates are downloaded automatically
- No telemetry or usage statistics are sent
- The app functions entirely offline

## Third-Party Services

Mic-Lock does not integrate with or use any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Data Security

Since Mic-Lock does not collect or store any data:
- There is no personal data at risk
- No encryption of personal data is needed (as none exists)
- No data breaches are possible (as no data is collected)

## Children's Privacy

Mic-Lock is safe for users of all ages as it does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Open Source Transparency

Mic-Lock is open source software:
- The complete source code is available for review on GitHub
- You can verify that no data collection occurs by examining the code
- Community contributions are welcome and transparent

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will:
- Update the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy
- Provide notice of significant changes in the app or repository
- Maintain our commitment to not collecting personal data
